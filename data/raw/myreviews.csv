One thing I've noticed is how polite the fellow passengers are! This airline has reduced the stress of flying immensely! Our affinity credit card meant we got 2 free bags. Everyone gets reserved seats. The online booking is Best in the Biz! Flight attendants, ground crew all superb.. For me I call it the Nordstrom's of the Skies. Free in-flight entertainment (gotta get the free GoGo Entertainment app on your device before boarding- it's the one with the cloud logo)"

We waited there for the weather to clear and returned after 2 hours. Covid guidelines are followed inside and the flight is clean.

I spent over 3 hours on the phone with my travel agent (i have used them for 20+ years) but they blamed Alaska. Long story short they finally got me back on the same flight as my GF but i we were not in the same cabin or seats. I was so bummed. I called Alaska and talked to Glenn out of Seattle Alaska and he was beyond amazing! he took care of everything and was able to fix it for me for a small fee and i could not be more impressed with his customer service! By far the best ever in my 1,000+ flights they for sure earned more of my business in the future!"

I have $660 in flight credit on Alaska from our cancelled spring break plans that we were not allowed to fly out of the country for. Of course, they would not refund the tickets outright, so we have this flight credit that is expiring next year. I'm looking at what possible options I have to use it and I want to book a one way ticket for my daughter to fly up to visit family before Thanksgiving. She's an unaccompanied minor, so I call to ask the procedure for booking. The agent Donna from Boise, tells me that I should book the ticket using my credit certificate online because she can't take it over the phone. But I should lie about my daughter's age and then call back and make the adjustment over the phone. So I go online and book a FIRST CLASS ticket for my 6 year old daughter using my credit. Then when I call customer service again to change her age, Bethany tells me that ""for future reference"" this is not what I should do. I tell her that instead of telling me this, she should tell ""Donna from Boise"" so that she doesn't keep giving people wrong info. She then says she's transferring me to a supervisor because she can tell I'm pretty upset at this point. I've already spent an hour on hold, waiting for calls back, online booking ticket, etc. Next I get a supervisor, Stephanie B9 from Phoenix. She says she will help me. Great. However, I'm expected to pay out of pocket the additional $50 unaccompanied minor fee. They can't use my credit certificate to cover the cost. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I then say, well then, I would like a refund for all of my tickets so I can go book on another airline because the reality is that I would prefer to book on another airline with a better flight schedule and airports, I was only using Alaska to use up my credit. In order to use a fraction of my credit, I would have to go out of pocket AGAIN to fly on Alaksa? NO THANK YOU! Stephanie says she cannot do that. Well, then I guess I will just cancel my ticket and book on another airline anyway. UNBELIEVABLE. AND THESE CROOKS ARE LOOKING FOR A BAILOUT!!???!? I HOPE THEY ALL GO OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!"

A day after sending a somewhat curt, perhaps boiler-plate reply, they sent a more comprehensive, and thoughtful one, addressing all of my questions. It did increase my confidence in their approach somewhat. I am grateful that someone took the time to digest what I had to share about my recent travel experience where the mask policy ran the gamut from non-existent to fully applied. I remain cautious, however, and still do not plan to fly if I can avoid it until there is a vaccine, simply because it's not realistic to think that flight attendants can police every non-compliant passenger every minute of every flight. And from personal experience, I can say that there are plenty of them in every airport and on every flight -- from the most egregious who whip their masks off in order to sneeze or cough, to the ones who wear their masks over their mouths but not faces, or just around their necks."

Gave them full details and then specifically asked for an explanation of the actual policy (since what is on their web site is not what happens in reality), why there was such dramatic variation in how their employees are applying the policy, and what AS management is doing to lead by example. Am a very frequent flyer with Gold status and over 25 years loyalty. I received a one-paragraph email reply parroting back the stated (but imaginary) policy, and ignoring the other questions. The representative said my experience would be looked at internally and signed off with ""cheers"". While I have been a devoted AS customer and generally like their service, based on their incomplete at best (cavalier at worst) response, I cannot recommend them at this time. I don't think they have the wherewithal to do enforce their own policies and didn't feel safe flying with them. I'm basing this on the egregious behavior of their employees not enforcing the mask requirement at all on two flights out of four and would warn would-be customers to avoid AS until there is a vaccine."

I am traveling for an emergency and was told I would have to ""rebook"" even though I arrived early. I was able to find an agent to assist me instead of waiting in the long line. She put my bag through and called the gate to know that I was on my way. Went right through TSA (with my dog and carrier) and ran to the gate. The plane had not left and I was greeted by two sneering gate agents who were unapologetic.

Their excuse was that I was not checked in. That is impossible because I was checked in with a boarding pass in hand. The flight had not left yet. They were nasty about rerouting and told me I better hurry because the reroute through SFO wouldn't be waiting for me either. I then had to run again with my heavy luggage. And they even told me the wrong gate, so luckily the other agent called to me because she noticed my dog. Seattle flight attendants were also incredibly condescending and rude. SFO flight attendants were much more polite. I will never fly alaska again and will stick with Delta, United, American."

From the moment we were to depart in LAX on October 17, 2020 the ticket agents were rude, unsympathetic and more than 5 of my family members missed their flight although they had already checked in on-line the night before. The ticket agent said we were late...although we were there on time and none of their kiosks were working. So they couldn’t put us on the flight until the next day and we had to pay more money, because we bought ‘saver fare’ I advise all to not buy any of their special promotions. It’s all false. Me and my husband got on a flight that day and they charged us more money....another $50 each already on the price that we paid. Now a week later after our vacation as I am sitting on the floor at the airport in Cabo, because they decided to change our flight from the original 4;30 to 12;pm unbeknownst to me. They sent an email less than 24 hours and for those who know the WiFi is slow in Mexico so of course our email didn’t refresh. So they told us that there were no seats, although we had our confirmation and our other 5 family members got on the same flight. We had to book a flight with Volaris a Mexican airlines from Cabo to Tijuana , because the manager: Kit with Alaska airlines said she couldn’t do anything for me until the next day. I told her we can sit with our family as we all traveled together. There is no need to leave an empty seat between us. She said ‘oh, it’s full there is nothing. So now Im at the terminal 1 in Cabo airport waiting for a more reliable airlines from Mexico to get me home.... since Alaska customer agents can’t do their job in LA, or on the phone nor in Cabo! I strongly urge customers not to buy tickets on Alaska to Cabo. Such a horrible airline with the same horrible employees. I will be posting this in all of my social media blogs, trip advisor and much more. Also here is a photo of the empty seats they said were full as we left LAX and we were in the air... I counted more than 10 empty seats!"

First flight for us since the pandemic. Heard of all the precautions Alaska has implemented since. Check in was excellent - we'd not printed out bag tags and attached - the person taking our bags cheerfully had no issues and had them printed and affixed. Basically no waiting. Gate agents we very customer focused - traveling companion was deaf and one of them came up to motion us to the gate when it was time to preboard. The Q400 prop plane is a 2-2 configuration for seating and one of the seats in each row was to be blocked off for social distancing. Unfortunately and the reason for one less star was that this was a heavily booked flight and about 55 of the 72 seats were in use. Felt a bit uncomfortable with so many on this flight but the attendants made sure all were compliant with masks and the flight was only 90 minutes. Uneventful flight that arrived a little early. Very appreciative of the Alaska crew members.

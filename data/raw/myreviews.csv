Check-in was simple on their app, flights all left on time, friendly service, and a clean plane. As we were de-boarding, staff was already coming onboard to start cleaning; I felt like they were taking it seriously. Also, they were GREAT about enforcing people wearing masks. They even called out a few times, ""mask over the nose please"" which I liked. I have flown over airlines during COVID and they were not nearly as on top of people keeping their masks on and on properly. I will try to fly with them again!","{'Seat comfort': 4.0, 'Customer service': 5.0, 'Cleanliness': 5.0, 'Food and Beverage': 4.0, 'Legroom': 4.0, 'In-flight Entertainment': 3.0, 'Value for money': 5.0, 'Check-in and boarding': 5.0}"

From the time I booked, I received very clear instructions and great service. Before boarding I was asked if I'd like to board first which was a huge relief because I didn't know how I was going to get around everyone. Then on the plane the flight attendants helped me with my luggage and constantly came by to make sure my dog Sammie was comfortable and had water. Everyone was so friendly and nice the entire process. I was sad I couldn't fly Alaskan home!",{}

I received no refund even though my doctor provided proof of incident. I spoke with the supervisor on the phone and she was extremely rude. I will never fly with this company again.

We were on military orders and had tons of bags. We were overweight on baggage and they didn’t charge us extra!!! Our baggage agent was so nice and really took the stress out of checking everything in, including getting our pets onboard. This was our first time flying Alaskan and will not be our last!

There is no announcement when deplaning on people going row by row and spacing themselves. Everyone just got off the plane like it was normal times, i.e. crowding, reaching over each other for luggage, trying to get off asap.",{'Check-in and boarding': 1.0}

# FlyWhy
Why do people fly an airline, and how do they feel about it over time.

A recent web article on [The biggest pain points in air travel and how to fix them - TNMT](https://tnmt.com/the-biggest-pain-points-in-air-travel/), got me thinking on how we might analyze just [Alaska Airlines TripAdvisor Reviews](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729017-r773099398-Alaska_Airlines-World.html).
		
To that end, I started this side project, "FlyWhy: Why do people fly an airline, and how do they feel about it over time."

The goals are threefold:

  1. Analyze the TripAdvisor Reviews to Derive Insights that could be leveraged for action.
  1. Learn Python
  1. Learn Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms

## Getting Started
Getting up and running with FlyWhy is pretty easy. At the moment, there is only one file that does all the work.
```
/src/data/getReviews.py
```

Its always helpful to create a new virtual environment
```
python -m venv flywhy
.\flywhy\scripts\activate
cd </flywhy>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .\src\getReviews.py
```
## Comparing FlyWhy Dataset with TNMT Analysis
According to the web article [The biggest pain points in air travel and how to fix them - TNMT](https://tnmt.com/the-biggest-pain-points-in-air-travel/), the analysis consisted of the following:
  1. On TripAdvisor, we scraped more than 15,000 reviews of 12 major airlines to get an industry-wide perspective on how travelers review their travel experiences.
  1. The data was sampled for 2019 to phase out the COVID-19 impact, which would skew the data to customer service and refund issues.
  1. We then analyzed the data with the help of a Natural Language Processing (NPL) tool called Quid Netbase.
  1. We looked at the topics travelers mentioned the most in their TripAdvisor reviews.
  1. We need to identify the underlying sentiment of each review to understand which topics travelers consider pain points and gain points.
  1. We ranked the major topic clusters according to whether they contain more positive reviews (labeled as a gain point) or more negative reviews (representing a pain point).
  
## Background on Prior Attempts			 
Original attempt was to use Python on Linux (so this could eventually be run on Databricks in Azure Cloud), following the the technique outlined in this link, [NLP-with-Python/Web scraping Hilton Hawaiian Village TripAdvisor Reviews.py at master Â· susanli2016/NLP-with-Python (github.com)](https://github.com/susanli2016/NLP-with-Python/blob/master/Web%20scraping%20Hilton%20Hawaiian%20Village%20TripAdvisor%20Reviews.py). This script utilized the BeautifulSoup library for screen scraping. Unfortunately, the TripAdvisor site executed a lot of JavaScript which BS does not handle.

After a few more rabbit holes and trying to use headless chrome on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), I switched to Puppeteer/C#. This would not allow me to accomplish my 2nd learning objective above.

To get back on track, I asked our internal team members for additional guidance.

Feedback from internal collaborators suggested:
  1. I've also had good luck with the PhantomJS driver for Selenium for lightweight headless deploys... still pretty heavy compared to beautifulsoup but can be helpful depending on the need. Here's a quick article I pulled up on PhantomJS: https://realpython.com/headless-selenium-testing-with-python-and-phantomjs/

  1. Selenium

I was able to get over the hurdle, and get started scraping reviews. This project on github is the result.

If you're interested in learning, or would like to give some constructive feedback, please join in on the fun.
